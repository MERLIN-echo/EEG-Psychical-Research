Knowing The Future - iOS App. Build a software interface using numbers, iconography and graphs to measure electroencephalogram output from participant of psychical test phenomenon in guessing numbers on a computer screen while hearing specific types of music or static sounds. Application will record heart rate, alpha to theta waves. Include MADAR III magnetic anomaly readings from node Los Altos, California for potential unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) arrival or presence. Plot performance of guesses correct and incorrect with time of day and hourly dietary daily menu of the event. Record weather, time of day in sidereal time and UTC time.  Image-guessing database of locations, objects and numbers, including glyphs from Palo Alto CARET Laboratory via DroneTeam.com can be customized by the participant. Objective knowing the future to improve on user accuracy.


MERLIN Time Travel - iOS Apple Watch App. Detects psychical events at a press of a button by recording the magnetic field, heart rate, EEG data and exact GPS coordinates of event. Time Travel will compare real-time with recorded time for comparison of possible time-slip phenomenon that have been reported from Bold Street in Liverpool, England in year 2000s. Built-in Bluetooth voice recorder to report paranormal phenomenon at a press of the button.

MERLIN Echo - iOS App. Monitor participants visualizing a future event from imagination of a mile-wide triangular aerial object above the ocean off the coast of Ocean Beach of San Francisco, California. Participants invite the mile-wide triangular aerial objects of 1997 March 13 reported by over 10,000 citizens of Arizona following comet Hale-Bopp event. 

Project Merlin Test list of monitoring gravitation distortion of time phenomenon, potential telekinesis experiments, recognizing dream telepathy patterns and invisible audio events. Recording and photographing probabilities in disappearing object phenomenon. This page will be updated monthly.
